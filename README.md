<ins> Game Description: </ins> 
Lance of Destiny is an fun and competitive game to play. 
It can be played singleplayer or multiplayer. There are several types of barriers 
that the player needs to break in order to win the game. Benelovent and Good spells exists
in the game, making the game more difficult or easier for the player.

challenging game.
Each player uses a magical staff to deflect the fireball to break down the barriers. Magical
staff can be moved by using arrow keys. Additionally, the staff can rotate up to 45 degrees 
to hit the ball from different angles. The Fireball is the object that is sent around to
destroy barriers, but it is affected by gravity, and uses simple physics for collisions.

Lance of Destiny


Game Description:
Lance of Destiny is an fun and competitive game to play. 
It can be played singleplayer or multiplayer. There are several types of barriers 
that the player needs to break in order to win the game. Benelovent and Good spells exists
in the game, making the game more difficult or easier for the player.
In multiplayer mode, players can use benelovent spells against each other for a more 
challenging game.
Each player uses a magical staff to deflect the fireball to break down the barriers. Magical
staff can be moved by using arrow keys. Additionally, the staff can rotate up to 45 degrees 
to hit the ball from different angles. The Fireball is the object that is sent around to
destroy barriers, but it is affected by gravity, and uses simple physics for collisions. 


Game Rules:
If the Fire Ball falls below the Magical Staff, the warrior loses a chance. Each
warrior has 3 chances only. Once the warrior runs out of chances, the game is over.
In multiplayer, two players play the game synchronously while seeing their opponent's
barrier count and score. When both games end, the player with higher score wins the game.
